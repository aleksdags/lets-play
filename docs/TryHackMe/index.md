This page contains some of the activities I've completed on TryHackMe, I haven't thought about writing when I started doing these which I probably should've.

During my last two terms of university, I wanted to explore several aspects of ITCS. I did UI/UX and QA for my internship but I never got to do anything network related. On my last internship I stumbled upon John Hammond, he put up a video where he was doing CTFs in TryHackMe. I got curious and created an account, the timing couldn't be any better as Advent of Cyber was about to start. Advent of Cyber is their version of the advent calendar, but instead of gifts you get daily challenges. I decided to participate and grew a liking for blue team related tasks, after the event I enrolled in their SOC 1 pathway and delved down the rabbit hole.

This page contains some of the activities I've completed on TryHackMe. Looking back, I wish I had started documenting my learning journey from the beginning—but better late than never!

During my final two terms at university, I wanted to explore different aspects of IT and cybersecurity. While my internships gave me valuable experience in UI/UX and QA, I never had the opportunity to work with anything network or security-related. 

Everything changed during my last internship when I discovered John Hammond's YouTube channel. I watched him tackle CTF challenges on TryHackMe and immediately knew I had to try it myself. The timing was perfect—Advent of Cyber was just about to begin. This annual event transforms the traditional advent calendar concept into daily cybersecurity challenges, and I decided to dive in.

Those 25 days were transformative. I found myself drawn to blue team activities—incident response, threat hunting, and defensive security. The hands-on approach clicked with me in a way that traditional coursework hadn't. After Advent of Cyber ended, I was hooked and enrolled in TryHackMe's SOC Level 1 learning pathway.

## My TryHackMe Journey

Below are writeups and reflections from some of the rooms and challenges I've completed. Each one taught me something new about cybersecurity, and I hope my notes might help others on their own learning paths.
