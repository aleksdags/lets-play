## Backup your server data
**Remember to backup your server before updating to prevent loss of data**
This would depend on the modpack that you're using as each has their own directory structure.
- World save
- Modified configs
## Which files do you need to copy?
- World save
	- Rlcraft Dregora - ./DregoraRL
	- ATM10 - ./world
- local
- server.properties
- your run script - make sure to also update the mod loader if updated
- eula.txt - so you dont have to rerun again
- configs that you've modified
## Download the latest server files
- Extract the server files to a new directory
- Copy over the files you've backed up earlier `world save`, `local`, `server.properties`, `run script`, `eula.txt`.
	- Not every modpack has a `local` folder
Notes: 
Modify your run script if the modpack's mod loader got updated
Don't forget to transfer your local mod data, such as JEI and Journey map, if creating a new mod profile for your host device.
