This page contains some of the activities I've completed on TryHackMe, I didn't start writing when I started doing these which I probably should've.

During my last two terms of uni, I wanted to explore several aspects of ITCS. I did UI/UX and QA for my internship but I never got to do anything network related.

I stumbled upon John Hammond, he put up a video where he was doing CTFs in TryHackMe

Thats how I started doing Advent of Cyber and liking doing Blue team related tasks.
